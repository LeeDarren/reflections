What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The answer is on the laptop!
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The answer is also on the laptop!
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	You can add a certain amount of changed files to the staging area for a commit 
	while leaving unrelated changes outside of the staging area.  The work will still
	there in your working directory but not in the commit.  You can immediately start
	another commit afterwards in a logical chunk.  
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	If you need to add or change something as a test but don't want it implemented in the main project until later.
	Branching would allow you to work adding it and merge the changes on later.
