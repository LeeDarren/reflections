When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Maybe when you want to access the repo from a remote location like another computer or if
  you are sharing code with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes new changes may mess up your current work or maybe you are working on an alternate
	version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches are different paths within a single repo.
	Clones are copies of a repo on your computer.
	Forks are copies of a repo on GitHub.
	Branches are for working on a single repo, either multiple development paths or by multiple individuals.
	Clones are for when you need to pull code to your own computer, either from a GitHub repo or a local one
	to make a duplicate copy for other purpose.
	Fork is when you need to make a copy of a repo on GitHub, usually borrowing someone's work for your own copy.
