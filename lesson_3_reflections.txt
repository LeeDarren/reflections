When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Maybe when you want to access the repo from a remote location like another computer or if
  you are sharing code with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes new changes may mess up your current work or maybe you are working on an alternate
	version.
